# LC-MS_tutorials

Welcome to this endeavour where I attempt to document all that I have learnt in my journey in the realm of mass spectrometry, LC-MS and Triversa Nanomate direct infusion.

The hope is to create a publicly-accessible resource that holds not just high-level concepts surrounding liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry etc., but also useful tricks that make life easier during data generation or calibration & maintenance (tips-&-tricks that are often only gained from experience, or chatting with experienced professionals, or obscure discussion forums).
