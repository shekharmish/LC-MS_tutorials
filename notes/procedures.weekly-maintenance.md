1. Calibration: Once a week, the Orbitrap-MS has to be calibrated using the Postive and Negative Cal Mixes purchased from Thermo. Contact Yujie & Jingxia from Zhao lab for the new location of the Cal Mixes and for any other issues encountered in spray stabilization during calibration.
2. Ion transfer tube replacement (aka capillary tube) – Once a week, replace the ion transfer tube. Remember to cool down Ion transfer tube to 50°C before replacing, otherwise the metal expands too much. Once you’re down to the final clean ion transfer tube, wash the dirty ion transfer tubes with the methanol-water sonication method.
3. Pump ballasting – Once a week, ballast the pump for 20 mins. Ballast protocol diagram can be referred from the sticky note underneath the LC-MS computer’s keyboard.

`Note 1`: All the above steps are advised once a week use regular/constant use of the instrument. But if the instrument is sparsely or irregularly used, all 3 steps can be performed once in 2 weeks.

`Note 2`: For Elia, the ideal time to perform these maintenance steps would be on Tuesday morning, right at the beginning of the Sweedler lab instrument slot, and in this order:
1. While the HESI is still connected, perform calibration.
2. Cool down the HESI to 50°C, then replace ion transfer tube.
3. During cool down, perform pump ballast.
4. After ion transfer tube replacement, install Nanomate source, and heat up ion transfer tube to 200°C.
